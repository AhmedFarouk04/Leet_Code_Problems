📘 **Week 3 – Stack & Monotonic Stack**
🎯 **Goal of the Week**
Understand and use **Stack** to solve problems that involve:

* Order
* Finding the next/previous element
* Evaluating expressions

🧠 **Core Concepts Learned**

1️⃣ **Stack Basics**

* LIFO (Last In First Out)
* Operations: `push`, `pop`, `peek`
* Useful for problems with:

  * Matching opening/closing
  * Going back
  * Tracking previous state

2️⃣ **Monotonic Stack**

* A stack that keeps elements in **increasing** or **decreasing** order
* Used for:

  * Next Greater Element
  * Previous Smaller Element
  * Nearest bigger/smaller element

📂 **Problems Covered This Week**

* **Valid Parentheses** → Check brackets using Stack
* **Min Stack** → Stack supporting `getMin()` in O(1)
* **Daily Temperatures** → First hotter day using Monotonic Stack
* **Next Greater Element I** → Find next greater element using Stack + HashMap
* **Next Greater Element II (Circular)** → Same but for circular array
* **Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation** → Evaluate expressions using Stack
* **Largest Rectangle in Histogram** → Find largest rectangle area in O(n)

⏱️ **Complexity Pattern**

* Most solutions:

  * **Time:** O(n)
  * **Space:** O(n)
* Each element enters the stack once and leaves once

🧩 **Key Takeaway**
If a problem asks:

> “Find the first bigger/smaller element to the left or right”
> 👉 Think **Monotonic Stack** immediately
